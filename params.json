{"name":"Pursuing Stacks","tagline":"LaTeX version of Grothendieck's Pursuing Stacks","body":"Pursuing Stacks\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThese files form a LaTeX-version of Grothendieck's _Pursuing Stacks_\r\n(PS) typescript from 1983. The files are released into the public\r\ndomain. It is requested, though, that positive changes or alternative\r\nlayouts are shared if they could be of help to others.\r\n\r\nPDFs\r\n----\r\n\r\nSoon, we'll have here compiled PDFs ready for download, as well as\r\nthe original scan of the PS typescript.\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe included `Makefile` is set up so that all you should need is to\r\ntype `make` if you have a recent\r\n[TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) installation (including the\r\n`pdfcrop` tool). The reason a `Makefile` is helpful is because three\r\n`pdf`-files, `simplex.pdf`, `square.pdf` and `globe.pdf` are made only\r\nonce and then only included once when compiling the main document\r\n(these contain symbols for the three main shape categories mentioned\r\nthroughout PS).\r\n\r\nTo Do List\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- review of all equivalences (`\\equ`) vs isomorphisms (`\\sim`)\r\n- change many `\\piz` to `\\bpiz` (when the source is `\\Cat` mainly)\r\n- say something about later developments inspired by PS\r\n- proof-read, check kerning, add more notes\r\n- put in more forward references to corrections and errata\r\n- figure out missing bits:\r\n  * many bits on page 7,8 (section 16bis)\r\n  * \"highlighted\" bits on page 15,16 (section 21)\r\n  * the assumption on page 30 (section 28)\r\n  * the footnote on page 115 (section 51)\r\n  * the rest of page 246 (end of section 78)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
